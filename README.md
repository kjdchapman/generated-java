# Generated Java SOAP Service code

This repo is java code generated from using "wsdl2java", to get us towards a simulator of [DRS, a scheduler we're trying to connect to](https://www.oneadvanced.com/products/dynamic-resource-scheduler/).

The generating script is [in another repository](https://github.com/kjdchapman/java2wsdl-with-gradle). I recommend not editing any of the code here manually!
